There were initial run issues that were solved by following the suggestion 
here: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/36508
The solution involves setting the device properly at initialization:

import tensorflow as tf
physical_devices = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(physical_devices[0], enable=True)
