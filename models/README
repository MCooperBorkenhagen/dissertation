This directory contains experiments/ simulations of various kinds.
The Learner class that powers them all can be found in:

./Learner (/Learner.py)

# EXPERIMENTS #
###############
Experiments are identified with an identifier at the start of
the filename (e.g., multi-, mono-, taraban-)


mono
----
The mono simulations pertain to a set of general purpose monosyllabic
words and serve as the basic set of data for analyzing the monosyllabic
learner (LSTM-based) relative to its feedforward counterpart. The
scripts marked with mono-lstm are LSTM based, and those with mono-feedforward
are FF based.


taraban
-------
These simulations are very similar to the mono-lstm simulations but with
the taraban and jared (1990) words added to investigate those effects.


multi
-----
These are simulations for multisyllabic words.

physical_devices
----------------
There were initial run issues that were solved by following the suggestion 
here: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/36508
The solution involves setting the device properly at initialization:

import tensorflow as tf
physical_devices = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(physical_devices[0], enable=True)
