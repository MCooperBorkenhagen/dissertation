This directory contains code that processes raw data and
makes it clean. The cleaning scripts sit in this top level 
along side the clean data files.

While there isn't a perfect 1:1 relationship between datafiles
and experiment/ learner scripts in model/, it is roughly
true that a given cleaning script here corresponds to a
particular learner in model given that data of a particular 
kind is usually generated for a specific learner in mind.
Some learners share data of a particular kind.
