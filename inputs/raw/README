This directory contains raw data relevant to 
specifying words and their forms (representations)
for modeling in the dissertation project. Some

----------------------------------
kidwords-missing-from-cmudict-1.json
----------------------------------
This file was created by Kaycie Barron in winter
2020-2021 and then supplemented in July 2021
and has words that are contained
within WCBC but are not transcribed by nltk's
implementation of cmudict (ie, they aren't contained
within cmudict in nltk). This file does not contain
morphological variants to those words, but
is added to the companion JSON that contains
those variants to compose the larger dictionary
of missing words from CMU.

-----------------------------------
kidwords-missing-from-cmudict-1.csv
-----------------------------------
This CSV contains the first round of missing 
words mentioned above but in tabular form. The
first round of words did not include the morphological
variants, which were added in summer of 2021. 
There are columns in this csv
that indicate additional useful data about
the words included in these datasets. Note
that the "sublist" column indicates if a
word included in the accompanying json file
is associated with more than one phonological
wordform in that json file.

--------------------------------------
wcbc-morphological-variants-to-add.csv
--------------------------------------
These are the additional morphological variants
put together by Kaycie Barron in summer of 2021
listed in tabular form.

-------------------------
all-missing-kidwords.json
-------------------------
This file contains the kidwords that are missing
from cmudict and their morphological variants. It
is constructed by adding together different JSON
files that contain separate lists of missing words
and their phological transcription in a single
JSON file to be specified for Traindata.
