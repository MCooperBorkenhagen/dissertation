This directory contains raw data relevant to 
specifying words and their forms (representations)
for modeling in the dissertation project. Some
(non exhaustive) notes:

----------------------------------
kidwords-missing-from-cmudict.json
----------------------------------
This file was created by Kaycie Barron in winter
2020-2021 and contains words that are contained
within WCBC but are not transcribed by nltk's
implementation of cmudict (ie, they aren't contained
within cmudict in nltk). The companion file to
this one is kidwords-missing-from-cmudict.csv. We
may not ultimately include these words in the
pool for modeling, but they are here for reference 
if needed.

---------------------------------
kidwords-missing-from-cmudict.csv
---------------------------------
This CSV contains the missing words mentioned
above but in tabular form. There are columns
that indicate additional useful data about
the words included in these datasets. Note
that the "sublist" column indicates if a
word included in the accompanying json file
is associated with more than one phonological
wordform in that json file.
