Mark Seidenberg gave an elementary school teacher an opportunity to get a very special kind of education. Thank you, Mark, this teacher won't forget it.

My wife, Kristen, has gracefully supported my ongoing education despite the incredible inconvenience it has caused in our lives. She's worked as much as I have to make my education happen.

Anything useful I know can be traced directly back to something Chris has taught me.

Any success I've had is far more due to the work and support of those around me than anything I've done.
