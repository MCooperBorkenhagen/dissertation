kawamoto1998 showed that words with less predictable pronunciations of the vowel exhibit longer latencies for the consonant in the onset, rather than simply longer overall naming latency of the entire word. This is due to the fact that the vowel pronunciations that are less predictable require more processing time, and this processing manifests in the system dwelling on pre-vocalic consonants. Their studies were performed using monosyllabic stimuli that were quite simple, though well established in the word reading literature related to naming and related phenomena.
